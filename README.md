# RSVP PWA Prototype (INF654)


## Description

This web app is intended to behave like a PWA, meaning it can cache and be installed. The function of the app is to RSVP to events that are listed. The user's response is recorded in a Google Sheet using a Google App Script. RSVP functionality requires a network connection, but the details of an event can still be viewed using cached storage.
